        is a COVID-19 vaccines appointments tracker, and the data will update as
        much as possible. Refresh the page as you want. We understand how hard
        to find a open appointment which close to us, and how crazy that people
        have to open tons of webpages and fresh them all the time. Hopefully,
        this project can help our neighbors in the bay area find the "best for
        you" vaccine appointments in ours local.Â
