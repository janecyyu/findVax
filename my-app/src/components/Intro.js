        is a COVID-19 vaccines appointments tracker, and the data is as up to
        date as possible. Refresh the page as needed. We understand how hard it
        is to find an open appointment close to us, and how crazy it is that
        people have to open tons of webpages and refresh them all the time.
        Hopefully, this project can help our neighbors in the bay area find the
        closest vaccine appointments to us.Â
