# VaxBay: A Vaccine Tracker in Bay Area, CA

VaxBay is a COVID-19 vaccines appointments tracker, and the data is as up to date as possible. Refresh the page as needed. We understand how hard it is to find an open appointment close to us, and how crazy it is that people have to open tons of webpages and refresh them all the time. Hopefully, this project can help our neighbors in the bay area find the closest vaccine appointments to us.

✔️ Checked Pharmacies: CVS, Pharmaca, Rite Aid, Safeway, Walgreens, Walmart, Costco

✔️ Checked Counties: San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa
